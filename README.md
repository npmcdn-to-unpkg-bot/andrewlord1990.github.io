## Technologies

- HTML: Page layouts
- CSS: Styling
- JavaScript: Customisation, client-side scripting
- Markdown: Page content
- [Bootstrap]: To help make it responsive, it scales correctly for screen sizes from mobile phones up to large desktops. I love writing websites using [Bootstrap].
- [Paper]: A Bootstrap theme to give elements Material Design styling.
- [Bower]: For managing my dependency packages really easily.
- [Jekyll]: Great for developing static websites, including a blog. You can construct pages from snippets of HTML reducing duplication and it makes creating new blog posts really quick and easy.
- [jQuery]: Needs no introduction.
- [Font-Awesome]: For really cool icons.
- [Isotope]: To create the sorting and filtering layout on my [Projects page](http://www.andrew-lord.co.uk#projects).
