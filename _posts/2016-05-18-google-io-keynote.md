Google IO 2016, the annual Google developer conference, has taken place at the Shoreline Amphitheatre, Mountain View, California, very close to the Googleplex. It kicked off with an exciting and announcement-packed keynote speech, delivered by various Googlers, starting with the Google CEO Sundar Pichai.

The keynote speech began at 10a.m. PT (UTC-8), for which I was lucky enough to get a seat right at the front, in one of the first few rows. The venue itself is outside, with an awning covering the front seating areas. Behind and to the sides of the stage were 3 huge high-definition screens. Whilst the audience was waiting for the keynote to begin, various videos and games requiring audience participation were presented across them.

### Introduction

The keynote kicked off which a segment discussing how our usage of technology and the internet has changed since Google first formed. There has been a huge shift of usage to mobile devices.

- 3 billion people are now connected to the internet, globally.
- 50% of Google queries now come from mobile devices
- 20% of Google queries are voice searches

Google's focus is on improving how they can improve users' lives, make everyday tasks easier and provide relevant content and suggestions. Rather than just showing links, Google search now shows content directly in the search results. They now have an understanding of over 1 billion entities - people, places and things. Google is starting to understand context, to provide accurate and useful information to users. Sundar showed an example of the Photos app showing all the pictures of hugs on the user's device. He then went on to show real time translation from English to Chinese directly in the camera feed, by aiming the camera at a sign written in English.

### Google Assistant

Previously, there has been various different assistant-style features offered by Google:

- Google Now: providing information relevant to you when you need it.
- OK Google: voice activated queries and voice searches
- Improvements in search results providing relevant content, beyond just the links themselves.
- Inbox: Smart auto-reply suggestions, understanding the context of your emails and the content within them.

Now, they have announced the Google Assistant, which will group all of these ideas into a voice-controlled conversational assistant. This will help you get things done in the real world, by interacting in a conversational manner. The assistant will understand the context of the conversation, for example if you had already queried about a particular person, later queries wouldn't need to repeat the name and could simply refer to them as "his" or "her". It knows a lot about the world, but will also, with your permission, get to know a lot about you too - accessing data such as daily schedules, journey to work, tastes and much more.

### Google Home

Alongside the assistant, [Google Home](https://home.google.com/) was announced. This is Google's equivalent of [Amazon Echo and Alexa](https://www.amazon.com/echo‎). It is a sleek device for your home, which will give you the power of the Google assistant in your home, through two-way dialog.

            img="posts/google-io-2016/keynote-home.jpg"
            title="Google Home" %}

- Play music on the built-in speaker, sourced from [Google Music](https://play.google.com/Music‎) and 3rd party services such as [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/).
- Cast [audio](https://www.google.com/chromecast/speakers/) or [video](https://www.google.com/chromecast) to connected devices.
- Tell it which room to play the content in.
- Manage everyday tasks, such as Todo lists, alarms and timers.
- Connect to smart home features such as lights and thermostats.
- Ask for information.

Google Home will launch later in the year, but Google plan to work with developers soon to get apps integrated in time for launch.

### Allo

The first surprising announcement was a new smart messaging app, called [Allo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.fireball). Bringing the power of Google to your chat conversations, including the assistant, encryption and many ways to express yourself.

{% include post-image.html
            id="keynoteAllo"
            img="posts/google-io-2016/keynote-allo.jpg"
            title="Allo chat messaging app"
            caption="Allo - chat augmented by the power of Google" %}
{% include modals/view-image.html
            id="keynoteAllo"
            img="posts/google-io-2016/keynote-allo.jpg"
            title="Allo chat messaging app" %}

Features mentioned:

- Whisper or shout: slide up and down to control how large a message is posted, to express how you are saying it.
- Use ink to draw on photos and post them.
- Smart reply suggestions 'on-the-fly' that will learn how you talk and improve over time.
- Suggestions in response to images - using computer vision to understand image contents and context.
- The assistant can provide information, book tickets, suggest restaurants and more, all within the chat.
- All messages are encrypted, but you can also use Incognito mode, which makes messages end-to-end encrypted, allow a message expiry to be specified and for a chat to be permanently deleted if you wish.

Allo will be available this summer on Android and iOS.

### Duo

Following Allo, there was a second surprising app announcement in [Duo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.tachyon). It is a simple 1-to-1 video calling app, for both Android and iOS, which features:

- End-to-end encryption
- Knock-knock: live stream of the caller before you pick up, making you feel more connected.
- Instantaneous transition from the live preview to the video call.
- Monitoring of signal strength and connection type - scaling quality to keep call stable.

Duo will be available this summer on both Android and iOS.

            title="Allo and Duo" %}

### Android

There weren't many surprises for Android N due to the fact the [developer preview](https://developer.android.com/preview/index.html) is already available. Google said they released it early to get help finding bugs, get early feedback and hopefully get it onto devices sooner. You can now submit your ideas for what Android N should be called at [android.com/N](https://www.android.com/versions/name-n/). However, Google do still reserve the right to select the name.

{% include post-image.html
            id="keynoteAndroid"
            img="posts/google-io-2016/keynote-android.jpg"
            title="Android N features"
            caption="Android N - lots of new features coming" %}
{% include modals/view-image.html
            id="keynoteAndroid"
            img="posts/google-io-2016/keynote-android.jpg"
            title="Android N features" %}

Many Android N features were mentioned:

- Support for the Vulkan graphics API - achieving lower CPU usage and advanced graphics performance on mobile.
- Major optimisations to the Android compiler.
- Seamless software updates: launch the device and it will already be up-to-date.
- Recent apps screen: Automatically clears older apps, new clear all button and double tap the recent apps button to switch instantly to last viewed app.
- Multi-window: split-screen apps by long pressing on recent apps button.
- Notifications: Cleaner, can group together, quick-reply and long-press to control visibility.

The aim is to release Android N later this summer and a beta release will be coming soon.

### Daydream VR

Virtual Reality is coming to Android N in the form of the Daydream platform. Firstly, devices must meet a specification to be considered "Daydream-ready", which tells users that a device is capable of high-quality VR. Secondly, there is a specification for what a VR headset should be capable of to be used with Daydream. A controller was also announced, containing sensors and movement tracking.

{% include post-image.html
            id="keynoteDaydream"
            img="posts/google-io-2016/keynote-daydream.jpg"
            title="Daydream controller"
            caption="The Daydream VR controller" %}
{% include modals/view-image.html
            id="keynoteDaydream"
            img="posts/google-io-2016/keynote-daydream.jpg"
            title="Daydream controller" %}

The home of Daydream will be Google Play, users will be able to view, install and run apps all within VR. Many Google apps will support it, you will be able to watch videos in a virtual movie theatre, view StreetView in VR and watch YouTube in VR. YouTube has been redesigned to include voice search, spatial audio, VR-designed videos and a way of viewing all standard videos.

Daydream will be available later in the year, but you can try [developing for it now](https://developers.google.com/vr/).

### Android Wear 2.0

A new version of Android Wear is coming, which is a complete redesign and rethink of the Android Wear platform.

- Watch faces can show data from other apps, user can customise what is shown.
- More input methods: smart-reply, keyboard and handwriting.
- Navigation overhaul and easier to use app launcher
- Google Fit activity recognition
- Standalone apps: work without a phone connected

A [preview is available now](https://developer.android.com/wear/preview/index.html) and the consumer release will be available later in the year.

### Android Studio

Android Studio is getting much faster, down to improvements in the IDE and the new emulator. The next version, 2.2, will make it 10x faster to run the app, the emulator will be 3x faster and you will get faster builds. Espresso tests will also become easier to create due to a recorder being added, to have your tests written for you.

Android Studio already had a layout designer tool, however, it wasn't that useful and most developers just wrote their layouts by hand. A new constraint layout was announced, whereby a view is laid out through constraints instead of nested layouts, all created through the visual designer.

Some new analysis tools will also be available: an APK analyser to find out why it is so large, a layout inspector and expanded code analysis tools to find issues.

### Firebase

A major update has been made to the Firebase platform, with many existing Google features, such as Google Cloud Messaging and App Indexing becoming part of Firebase. The new version of Firebase works with Android and iOS clients and contains cloud messaging, notifications, crash reporting, remote configuration of clients (for A/B testing) and is fully integrated into the Google Cloud Platform. Better still, it is [available now](https://firebase.google.com/).

            title="Firebase features" %}

### Android Instant Apps

Google left one the coolest announcements right until the end of the keynote - Android Instant Apps. You will be able to click a hyperlink and be taken into your native app, without installing it. This will be made possible by separating the app into separate modules, so only the required part needs to be downloaded to the device. When the app is used in this way, it will behave like a native app, so you will able to use features such as Android Pay. This could have a huge impact on discoverability, allowing people to use the app straight away, try it out and then install it if they wish, all in a seamless way.

To support this feature, some changes will need to be made to your app - making it more modular. You will still have full control over the user experience and it is even backwards compatible down to Android Jelly Bean! Google will be gradually rolling out access to developers and then will make it available to users later in the year.

### Wrap Up

The early release of the Android N developer preview meant there wasn't as many announcements about the new version of Android as usual. However, this year's keynote still contained many surprises and cool announcements.
