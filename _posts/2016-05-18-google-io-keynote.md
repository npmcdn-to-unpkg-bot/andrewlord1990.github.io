Google IO 2016, the annual Google developer conference, takes place at the Shoreline Amphitheatre, Mountain View, California, very close to the Googleplex. It kicked off with an exciting and announcement-packed keynote speech, delivered by various Googlers, starting with the Google CEO Sundar Pichai.

[Check out the schedule here](https://events.google.com/io2016/) if you are interested.

The keynote speech began at 10a.m. PT (UTC-8), for which I was lucky enough to get a seat right at the front, in one of the first few rows. The venue itself is outside, with an awning covering the front seating areas. Behind and to the sides of the stage were 3 huge high-definition screens. Whilst the audience was waiting for the keynote to begin, various videos and games requiring audience participation were presented across the screens.

### Introduction

The keynote kicked off which a segment discussing how our usage of technology and the internet has changed since Google first formed. The main change is that there has been a huge shift of usage to mobile devices.

- 3 billion people are now connected to the internet, globally.
- 50% of Google queries now come from mobile devices
- 20% of Google queries are voice searches

Google's focus is on improving how they can improve users' lives, make everyday tasks easier and provide relevant content and suggestions. Rather than just showing links, Google search now shows content directly in the search results. They now have an understanding of over 1 billion entities - people, places and things. Google is starting to understand context, to provide accurate and useful information to users. Sundar showed an example of the Photos app showing all the pictures of hugs on the user's device. He then went on to show real time translation from English to Chinese directly in the camera feed, by aiming the camera at a sign written in English.

### Google Assistant

Previously, there has been various different assistant-style features offered by Google:

- Google Now: providing information relevant to you when you need it.
- OK Google: voice activated queries and voice searches
- Improvements in search results providing relevant content, beyond just the links themselves.
- Inbox: Smart auto-reply suggestions, understanding context of your emails and the content within them.

Now, they have announced the Google Assistant, which will group all of these ideas into a voice-controlled conversational assistant. This will help you get things done in the real world, by interacting in a conversational manner. The assistant will understand the context of the conversation, for example if you had already queried about a particular person, later queries wouldn't need to repeat the name and could simply refer to them as "his" or "her". It knows a lot about the world, but will also, with your permission, get to know a lot about you too - accessing data such as daily schedules, journey to work, tastes and much more.

### Google Home

Alongside the assistant, [Google Home](https://home.google.com/) was also announced. This is Google's equivalent of [Amazon Echo and Alexa](https://www.amazon.com/echo‎). It is a sleek device for your home, which will give you the power of the Google assistant when you need it. You will be able to have a conversation with Google through two-way dialog.

- Play music on the built-in speaker system, or cast to [Chromecast audio](https://www.google.com/chromecast/speakers/) connected speakers. This will work through integration with [Google Music](https://play.google.com/Music‎) and 3rd party services such as [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/).
- Play video on [Chromecast](https://www.google.com/chromecast) connected screens.
- Tell it which room to play the content in.
- Manage everyday tasks, such as Todo lists, alarms and timers.
- Connect to smart home features such as controlling lights and thermostats through 3rd party integration.
- Ask for information, through access to Google search.

Google Home will launch later in the year, but Google plan to work with developers very soon to get apps integrated with the Google Assistant and Google Home in time for its launch.

### Allo

The surprising next announcement made was a new smart messaging app, called [Allo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.fireball). It brings the power of Google to your chat conversations, including the Google assistant, encryption and many ways to express yourself.

- Whisper or shout: by sliding up and down you can control how large a message is posted in, to express how you are saying it.
- Use ink to draw on photos and post them.
- Smart reply suggestions, these are suggested 'on-the-fly' and they will learn how you talk and improve over time.
- Suggestions made are unique to you and can also respond to images - computer vision used to understand what is in an image.
- The AI doesn't just identify what you might say, it suggests conversational responses.
- The assistant can also provide information, booking tickets, suggesting restaurants and more, all within the chat.
- All messages are encrypted, however, you can also use Incognito mode, which makes messages end-to-end encrypted.
- With Incognito mode, messages can have an expiry set and once the chat is deleted, it has gone forever.

Allo will be available this summer on Android and iOS.

### Duo

Following Allo, there was a second surprising app announcement in [Duo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.tachyon). It is a [FaceTime](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204380) competitor, which was marketed as a simple 1-to-1 video calling app, for both Android and iOS.

- End-to-end encrypted
- Knock-knock: You see a live stream of the caller before you pick up. This was said to be so you know why they are calling and to make you feel more connected.
- There is an instantaneous transition from the live preview to the video call.
- Monitoring of signal strength and connection type. The video quality can be scaled to ensure a stable and useable video call.

Duo will be available this summer on both Android and iOS.

### Android

There weren't really any major features announced for Android N which weren't already public knowledge. This is due to the fact that this year Google released a developer preview of Android N really early, to help find bugs, get feedback and hopefully get it available for devices earlier. They are allowing everyone to submit their idea for what Android N should be called at [android.com/N](https://www.android.com/versions/name-n/). However, they did say that Google reserves the right to select the name.

Many Android N features were mentioned:

- Support for the Vulkan graphics API - achieving lower CPU usage and advanced graphics performance on mobile.
- Major optimisations to the Android compiler.
- Seamless software updates: launch the device and will already be up-to-date.
- Recent apps screen: Remove older apps from it, clear all button and double tap to switch instantly to last viewed app.
- Multi-window: split-screen apps by long pressing on recent apps button.
- Notifications overhaul: Cleaner, group together, quick-reply and long-press to control visibility.

The aim is to release Android N later this summer and a beta-quality release will be coming soon.
