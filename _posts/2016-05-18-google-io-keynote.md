Google IO 2016, the annual Google developer conference, takes place at the Shoreline Amphitheatre, Mountain View, California, very close to the Googleplex. It kicked off with an exciting and announcement-packed keynote speech, delivered by various Googlers, starting with the Google CEO Sundar Pichai.

[Check out the schedule here](https://events.google.com/io2016/) if you are interested.

The keynote speech began at 10a.m. PT (UTC-8), for which I was lucky enough to get a seat right at the front, in one of the first few rows. The venue itself is outside, with an awning covering the front seating areas. Behind and to the sides of the stage were 3 huge high-definition screens. Whilst the audience was waiting for the keynote to begin, various videos and games requiring audience participation were presented across the screens.

### Introduction

The keynote kicked off which a segment discussing how our usage of technology and the internet has changed since Google first formed. The main change is that there has been a huge shift of usage to mobile devices.

- 3 billion people are now connected to the internet, globally.
- 50% of Google queries now come from mobile devices
- 20% of Google queries are voice searches

Google's focus is on improving how they can improve users' lives, make everyday tasks easier and provide relevant content and suggestions. Rather than just showing links, Google search now shows content directly in the search results. They now have an understanding of over 1 billion entities - people, places and things. Google is starting to understand context, to provide accurate and useful information to users. Sundar showed an example of the Photos app showing all the pictures of hugs on the user's device. He then went on to show real time translation from English to Chinese directly in the camera feed, by aiming the camera at a sign written in English.

### Google Assistant and Home

Previously, there has been various different assistant-style features offered by Google:

- Google Now: providing information relevant to you when you need it.
- OK Google: voice activated queries and voice searches
- Improvements in search results providing relevant content, beyond just the links themselves.
- Inbox: Smart auto-reply suggestions, understanding context of your emails and the content within them.

Now, they have announced the Google Assistant, which will group all of these ideas into a voice-controlled conversational assistant. This will help you get things done in the real world, by interacting in a conversational manner. The assistant will understand the context of the conversation, for example if you had already queried about a particular person, later queries wouldn't need to repeat the name and could simply refer to them as "his" or "her". It knows a lot about the world, but will also, with your permission, get to know a lot about you too - accessing data such as daily schedules, journey to work, tastes and much more.

Alongside the assistant, [Google Home](https://home.google.com/) was also announced. This is Google's equivalent of [Amazon Echo and Alexa](https://www.amazon.com/echo‎). It is a sleek device for your home, which will give you the power of the Google assistant when you need it. You will be able to have a conversation with Google through two-way dialog.

- Play music on the built-in speaker system, or cast to [Chromecast audio](https://www.google.com/chromecast/speakers/) connected speakers. This will work through integration with [Google Music](https://play.google.com/Music‎) and 3rd party services such as [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/).
- Play video on [Chromecast](https://www.google.com/chromecast) connected screens.
- Tell it which room to play the content in.
- Manage everyday tasks, such as Todo lists, alarms and timers.
- Connect to smart home features such as controlling lights and thermostats through 3rd party integration.
- Ask for information, through access to Google search.

Google Home will launch later in the year, but Google plan to work with developers very soon to get apps integrated with the Google Assistant and Google Home in time for its launch.
